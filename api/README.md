## Prerequisites

1. Node.js - Make sure you have Node.js installed (v14 or higher recommended).
2. MySQL - Install and run MySQL locally or use a remote MySQL server.
3. Nest CLI - Install the NestJS CLI globally if you haven’t already:

```
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

4 .env file - A .env file is required for setting database credentials and other environment variables.

## Installation

1. Install Dependencies

```
npm install

DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=<your-password>
DB_NAME=<your-database-name>
```

```
CREATE DATABASE <your-database-name>;
```
